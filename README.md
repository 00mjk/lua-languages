# lua-languages

## Languages that compile to Lua
Lua is famously and deceptively simple and enables many different programming paradigms. Like Javascript, it's possible to make it shine by adding more specialized syntax. I started this list to document the languages I found looking for an ML/F# like language.

### Tier 1
For lack of a better designator, these projects are well known (to me).
 - http://moonscript.org/
 Moonscript, indentation based syntax, based on coffeescript
 - https://github.com/PaulBernier/castl
 Javascript transpiler
 - https://github.com/yanghuan/CSharp.lua
 C# transpiler
 
### Lisp
There ere so many Lisp variants, the deserve their own category.
 - https://github.com/meric/l2l
 l2l (lisp) superset of Lua
 - https://squiddev.github.io/urn/
 Urn, Lisp dialect
 - http://leafo.net/moonlisp/
 Lisp implemented in Moonscript
